# DnD-AR
The goal of this project was to create an AR experience to assist in playing the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. 
We wanted to make a battle map which could be presented in 3D using AR.
We, therefore, developed an alternative to these expensive 3D models, which would also make it easier to transport.

This alternative was presented in the form of a mobile phone AR project, where the user could use their phone to view an AR 3D environment which would line up with the 2D battle map used by the non-AR users (to view by those not using AR). This would also allow users to play without the need to use AR, as holding your phone up the entire time you play would be tiring.

### Requirements to run:
An Andriod phone

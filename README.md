# DnD-AR
The goal of this project was to create an AR experience to assist in playing the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. 
We wanted to make what is called a battle map which could be presented in 3D.
Therefore the purpose of this project was to present a cheap alternative to giving a 3D battle map or one which would be easier to transport. 
This alternative was presented in the form of a mobile phone AR project, where the user could use their phone to view an AR 3D environment which would line up with the 2D battle map used by the non-AR users (to view by those not using AR).

### Requirements to run:
An Andriod phone
